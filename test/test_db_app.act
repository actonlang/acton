# Basic test case of the Acton RTS together with the database backend. We want
# to focus on things that lead to database interaction, so in essence calling
# actor methods / sending methods and execution of continuations. We also want
# to test the timer queue.
#
# main -> Foo."init" -> timerQ after 0 -> Foo.callback() -> main.final() -> exit
