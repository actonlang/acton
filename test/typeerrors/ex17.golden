2 |a = pow(3,"hej")

pow has had its polymorphic type [A(Number)] => (a: A, b: A) -> A instantiated to (a: t0, b: t0) -> t0, so
t0 must implement __builtin__.Number

The type of pow(3, "hej") ( __builtin__.str) must be a subclass of t0

The type of pow(3, "hej") (which we call t1) must be a subtype of t0
