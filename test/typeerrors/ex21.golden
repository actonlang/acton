ERROR: Error when compiling ex21 module: Type error

Cannot satisfy the following simultaneous constraints for the unknown type t0:

  |
4 |   print(math.sin("hej"))
  |         ^^^^^^^^
__builtin__.str must be a subclass of t0

  |
4 |   print(math.sin("hej"))
  |         ^^^^^^^^
math.sin has had its polymorphic type [A(math.RealFuns)] => (A) -> A instantiated to (t0) -> t0, so t0 must implement math.RealFuns
