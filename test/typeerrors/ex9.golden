ERROR: Error when compiling ex9 module: Type error

Cannot satisfy the following simultaneous constraints for the unknown types t0, t1:

  |
4 |a = f(3,"hej")
  |      ^
The type of 3 (which we call t0) must implement __builtin__.Number

  |
4 |a = f(3,"hej")
  |    ^
f has had its polymorphic type [A(Plus)] => (A, A) -> A instantiated to (t1, t1) -> t1, so t1 must implement __builtin__.Plus

  |
4 |a = f(3,"hej")
  |    ^^^^^^^^^^
Type incompatibility between definition of and call of f
f is inferred to have a type of the form [T_6w(__builtin__.Plus)] => (T_6w, T_6w) -> T_6w

  |
4 |a = f(3,"hej")
  |    ^^^^^^^^^^
Type incompatibility between definition of and call of f
f is inferred to have a type of the form [T_6w(__builtin__.Plus)] => (T_6w, T_6w) -> T_6w
