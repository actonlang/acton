Acton is a **advanced** general purpose programming language offering **functional** and **object-oriented** style of programming based on the **actor**-model and async I/O. **Type safe** and with **capabilities based** security, Acton is **statically compiled** for **high performance** and **portability**. In other words, pretty much *perfect* ;) We hope you enjoy it as much as we do. It's readily available to build anything from advanced "shell scripts" to low level databases.

Unique among programming languages, Acton offers **orthogonal persistence**, which means you don't have to think about how to persist data, or rather the state of your program, for durability. Acton will do it for you, using its fault-tolerant distribute database. Pretty damn cool!
