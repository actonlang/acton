# Naming

Acton has naming rules and conventions. Type variable names are reserved, so it is invalid to name a class `A` since all single character upper case names are reserved for type variables. Function and class names typically follow a convention as here outlined:

- **Functions**: `my_fun`, `another_fun_thing` - lower case characters with `_` to separate words
- **Actors** & **Classes**: `Foo`, `Bar`: Two or more alpha numeric characters, starting with an upper case character
- **Type variables**: `A`, `T1`: single upper case character, possibly followed by digits
