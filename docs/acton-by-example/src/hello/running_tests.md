# Running Tests

Writing tests is an integral part of writing software. In an Acton project, you can run all the tests by issuing `acton test`:

```console
foo@bar:~hello$ acton test

Tests - module hello:
  foo:                   OK:  278 runs in 50.238ms

All 1 tests passed (23.491s)

foo@bar:~hello$ 
```

See the [Testing](/testing.md) section on how to write tests.
