# Collections

Acton provides several built-in collection types for storing and organizing data.

- [Lists](collections/lists.md) - ordered mutable sequences, like `[1, 2, 3]` or `["foo", "bar"]`
- [Dictionaries](collections/dicts.md) - ordered key-value mappings, like `{"foo": 1, "bar": 3}`
- [Sets](collections/sets.md) - unordered collections of unique elements, like `{"foo", "bar"}`

All collection types require elements to be of the same type. For example, a list can contain only integers or only strings, but not both. Similarly, dictionary keys must all be of the same type, and all values must be of the same type.
