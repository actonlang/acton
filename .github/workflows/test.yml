name: Build, Test & Release

# Build, Test & Release (BTR) run for:
# - pushes to the main branch
# - new tags are pushed
# - for pull requests
#
# Releases are tagged with vX.Y.Z. We determine if we are building for a release
# or not by looking if the tag name starts with 'v'.
#
# To release:
# - create new branch using name: release-vX.Y.Z
# - update version in common.mk
# - update CHANGELOG.md, second entry must equal version in common.mk
#   - first entry is assumed to be "Unreleased"
# - push a tag like vX.Y.Z which is equal to version in common.mk
#

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
    tags:
      - v*

# NOTE: Jobs for version tagged releases just pattern match on any tag starting
# with 'v'. That's probably a version tag, but could be something else. Is there
# a better way to match?

  # This job test builds the Homebrew Formula in this repo. We'd really like to
  # use brew test-bot for this, but it's a little too opinionated and rigid
  # about how things should workd. It assumes that it is running in our
  # actonlang/homebrew-acton repository. We made initial attempts to fake that
  # environment by overwriting GITHUB_REPOSITORY and overwriting the formula
  # with the formula in this (actonlang/acton) repo but it is ultimately futile
  # as the test-bot actually pulls down the real actonlang/homebrew-acton repo,
  # so we cannot get it to test local files.
  # In order to get it to test our Formula that is unreleased, we rewrite the
  # Formula so that the head/revision matches the current git commit sha and run
  # all brew commands with --HEAD. Some commands for verification do not support
  # --HEAD, so we skip them, but they are later run in the homebrew-acton repo
  # anyway. The point is mostly to validate as much as possible of the Formula
  # here, before we push it to homebrew-acton.
  # We only run on macos-12 as it is faster than macos-11 for some weird reason.
  # The Formula will be tested on all current versions of macos + one Linux once
  # its pushed to the homebrew-acton repository.
