We assign precedences to operator expressions according to their main operator as follows.
The Python language reference does not assign numerical precedences, but the precedence order
implied by the syntax rules is consistent with the values below, with one exception:
Quote from section 6.5 in The Python Language Reference (v 3.8.6):
    "The power operator binds more tightly than unary operators on its left; 
     it binds less tightly than unary operators on its right."
Printing here does not minimize the use of parentheses; unary operator expressions are 
put in parenthesis (for clarity) in all operator contexts, also where the parser does not need them.
