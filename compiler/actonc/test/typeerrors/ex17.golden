ERROR: Error when compiling ex17 module: Type error

Cannot satisfy the following simultaneous constraints for the unknown types t0, t1:

  |
2 |a = pow(3,"hej")
  |    ^^^^^^^^^^^^
The type of the indicated expression (inferred to be __builtin__.str) must be a subclass of t0

  |
2 |a = pow(3,"hej")
  |    ^^^^^^^^^^^^
The type of the indicated expression (which we call t1) must be a subtype of t0

  |
2 |a = pow(3,"hej")
  |    ^^^
pow has had its polymorphic type [A(Number)] => (a: A, b: A) -> A instantiated to (a: t0, b: t0) -> t0, so t0 must implement __builtin__.Number

  |
2 |a = pow(3,"hej")
  |        ^
The type of the indicated expression (which we call t1) must implement __builtin__.Number
