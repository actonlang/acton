Cannot satisfy the following simultaneous constraints for the unknown type t0:

  |
3 |    for x in n:
  |             ^
The type of the indicated expression (which we call t0) must implement __builtin__.Iterable[_]

  |
3 |    for x in n:
  |             ^
The type of the indicated expression (inferred to be __builtin__.int) must be a subclass of t0
