/* 
 * During initialization of an Acton program we need to establish a one-to-one mapping between method tables and non-negative integers. 
 * The latter are called class id's and for each object being serialized, its class id is stored together with serialization of its
 * local state. During deserialization, the class id is used to find the object's method table and hence its __deserialize__ method.
 * Builtin classes and classes in the runtime system have predefined class id's, mainly to ease debugging (e.g. to make reading
 * hexdumps of serialized files slightly less painful).
 * 
 * This mechanism requires that the mapping between method tables and integers is the same in the serializing and the 
 * deserializing system. This will be the case if they do registration for the same classes in the same order, typically 
 * by being the same piece of software.
