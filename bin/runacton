# runacton, through use of a shebang line, allows execution of Acton source
# files a la "shell script" style. Start your .act source code file with:
#
#   #!/usr/bin/env runacton
#
# And you can execute it directly! Under the hood the .act source file is
# compiled by acton into a binary which is then executed. The original
# arguments are passed through.
