// NOTE: the standard srand / rand functions are not thread safe, but what does
// that really mean in this context? While we could use thread safe functions
// for deterministic random numbers (based on the seed), we won't guarantee
// deterministic scheduling of actors on our RTS threads and so there still
// would not be a guarantee for thread safe random numbers. Also, having to call
// srand to seed reflects the C implementation, which we're not keen on doing -
// rather we want it Pythonic - you should be able to get a random number with a
// single call to random.randint(1, 3). So instead we just seed on startup with
// the time, which is prolly good enough for now. In a future, we could cook up
// something better.
